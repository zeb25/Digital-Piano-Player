# Final-Project 
Purva Shirolkar & Zoe Bell

## Summary
A piano, C++, graphics program that uses an audio plug-in(JUCE) and displays a
graphical keyboard that the user can play using their mouse or laptop keys. The
visuals will display in a fixed size window with three different screens. The home
screen will have two buttons, one for the "free play" option, and one for the
"practice song" option. The "free play" screen will display the keyboard for the
user to freely play music with audio being output using the audio plug-in. The
"practice song" screen will display the keyboard and some instructions as to how
the user will practice. The computer will go through the song, playing the keys
and highlighting them on the keyboard, then after finishing it will start the
practice. The computer will play the first note of the song and highlight the key on
the keyboard, and wait for the user to play that same note before moving on to
the next note of the song. After finishing, the computer will play the song one
more time all the way through, then the user will have to also play the song all
the way through; if they do this correctly the practice rounds concludes and the
screen exits to the main menu, if the user doesn't correctly play all the keys, the
practice restarts. If the back key is pressed at any point, the user will exit to the
main menu.
