# Confetti Button

Hopefully you have something to celebrate, because the confetti is coming!

For this project, you will use C++ graphics with classes to get a button to react to mouse and keyboard activity.

You may work individually or with a partner of your choosing.

## Setup

Use this Guided Project template to create a new repository (see [GitHub-with-CLion](https://github.com/uvmcs2300s2024/GitHub-with-CLion) repo for directions).
**Your repository must be named with the convention: Confetti-Button-netid**, where netid is your UVM NetID username.
* If you are collaborating, the format is Confetti-Button-netid1-netid2. Have one partner create the repository and give the other partner access on GitHub: on the repository page, go to the Settings tab, choose Manage Access, and add the person with their GitHub username.

Remember to commit and push frequently.
