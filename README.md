# Final-Project 
Created by Zoe Bell & Purva Shirolkar

## Summary
A graphics program that displays a single piano octave and allows the user to interact with piano keys using a keyboard. Project utilizes a PortAudio audio library to generate sine sounds for the corresponding piano keys.
The program opens up to the start screen which offers two options for the user: press 'p' to practice a song or press 's' to freely
play the piano. The freePlay mode allows the user to play the piano using their laptop keyboard. The bottom two rows of the letter keys
correspond to the keys of the piano. The gamePlay mode goes through the keys to play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on the piano once before leaving the screen open for the user to practice.

This project was developed in C++ as a final project for Advanced Progamming.
